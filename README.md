# 🌍 Sustainable AI Protocol (SAP)

**The Environmental Operating System for the AI Age**

> "One small button. Enormous change. SAP transforms every AI interaction into a force for environmental good."

## 🎯 Mission: Solve the AI Power Paradox

SAP is the **environmental operating system for AI** - a universal protocol that not only makes invisible AI energy consumption visible, but uses the power of AI to solve its own environmental problems and extend beyond to create a pervasive environmental force.

### The AI Power Paradox
